# Style Guide
## Tone and Voice
Maintain a neutral, technical, and objective tone. Avoid colloquialisms or game-specific jargon unless defined.

## Units
All physical quantities must be expressed in SI units. Conversions to other unit systems are explicitly forbidden unless a specific reason is approved in the Decision Log.

## Citations
Use a consistent citation format (e.g., APA or Chicago author-date) and provide full references in [[90-Data-and-References/Sources/Bibliography]].

## Uncertainty
Clearly state known ranges, confidence intervals, and sources of variability.

## Diagrams and Figures
If referencing external diagrams, ensure proper attribution. Internal diagrams should be simple and clearly described in text.
