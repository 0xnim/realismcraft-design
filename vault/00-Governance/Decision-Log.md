# Decision Log
## How to use
Each entry should detail a specific decision, its context, the affected documents, rationale, and consequences.

## Entry Example
```markdown
## 2025-05-10 – DL-012 Soil pH ranges tightened
- Context: Inconsistent pH window vs phosphorus uptake.
- Decision: Narrow optimal pH for temperate cereals to 6.0–6.8 (was 6.0–7.0).
- Affected notes: [[10-World-and-Environment/Soils-and-Pedology]], [[30-Transformation-and-Processes/Agriculture-and-Soil-Management]]
- Rationale: Majority of cited agronomy sources favor narrower range.
- Consequences: Slightly reduced crop feasibility on calcareous soils without amendments.
- Status: Applied in v0.2.1
