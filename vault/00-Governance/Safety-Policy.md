# Safety Policy
## Purpose
This policy ensures that the 'Realism Bible' does not inadvertently provide actionable instructions for dangerous or unethical procedures.

## Content Restriction
Detailed, step-by-step instructions for the following are forbidden:
- Creation of explosives or dangerous chemicals.
- Processing of highly toxic materials without specialized equipment.
- Hazardous industrial processes that pose significant risk of injury or death.
- Detailed surgical or medical procedures.

## Abstraction
For restricted topics, content should be:
- **Conceptual**: Describe the 'what' and 'why', not the 'how'.
- **High-level**: Focus on principles, inputs, and outputs.
- **Annotated**: Clearly state that detailed procedures are omitted for safety.

## Review
The Safety Reviewer must sign off on any document touching on potentially hazardous topics.
