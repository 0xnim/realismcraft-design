## Intent & Inputs
- Inputs (materials, energy) with preconditions (moisture, particle size).

## High-Level Steps (non-actionable)
- Step 1: Purpose, control variables, signals (e.g., color/smoke) — conceptual.
- Step 2: ...

## Outputs
- Products/byproducts/wastes; indicative yields (ranges).

## Energy & Mass Considerations
- Qualitative balance; conservation notes.

## Risks
- Burns, fumes, structural failure; do not include step-by-step instructions.

## Alternatives
- Contextual substitutes (e.g., no clay → wattle-and-daub).
